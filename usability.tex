\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\section{Towards teaching Clojure in an introductory class}\label{sec:project}
Languages in the Lisp family have along history of being a successful first programming language for college-level students~\cite{Felleisen:2004}. 
Functional languages tend to have simpler, more uniform syntax and semantics that students master quickly.
They focus on functional abstraction, modularity, generalization, and recursion -- concepts that are essential for computer science methods of 
problem solving and a structural, systematic approach to software development. 
Lisps have been successfully used in introductory languages in many computer science college programs, including UMM. 

Clojure is a relatively new addition to the Lisp language family. Released in 2007 by Rich Hickey~\cite{Hickey:2008}, it has rapidly gained popularity in industry
and in programming community in general 
due to its elegant design and suitability for concurrent programming. A very active open source Clojure community has developed numerous 
libraries for a diverse set of applications.

\section{Error messages adapted for beginners}\label{sec:errors-work}
\emcomment{Make sure that examples are more involved than in the previous paper}

{\tt (first 3)}

\begin{verbatim}
In function first, the first argument 3 must be a sequence but is a number.
\end{verbatim}

\emcomment{Show original}

{\tt (even? 3 6 1)}

\begin{verbatim}
You cannot pass three arguments to a function even?, need one.
\end{verbatim}

{\tt ((fn [ x y] (+ x y)) 2)}

\begin{verbatim}
You cannot pass one argument to this anonymous function.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
Cannot call nil as a function.
\end{verbatim}

{\tt (nil 5)}
